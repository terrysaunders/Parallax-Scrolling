			<p>Slowly lining up to hit my mid thirties means that idols of my youth are dying (or being arrested) at a rate of knots. </p>
			<p>I was slightly taken aback, however, at how much I was affected by the passing of Lou Reed. </p>
			<p>Although definitely a fan I wasn't super clued in to his life's work. I liked The Velvet Underground, I've tried to listen to Berlin several times and I had no idea what he'd done for the last ten years or so. </p>
			<p>But Transformer, now that album was special.  Transformer is in my top five albums. Odd as the rest of this list (and probably most of the top ten) are albums released in the years when I was between 16-19. </p>

		    	<p>I, like most people growing up in the early eighties had access to a vast analogue trove of music in the form of my mum's 70s LPs that were all lined up under the telly. </p>
		    	<p>This may have been pre-compact disc, cassette may have been king but having this slice of history under my eyeline when I was watching Tripod's or Blue Peter gave me endless fascination.</p>
				<p>Among this list were some gems but at this age of musical education all I had to go on were names and pictures and so  Manhattan Transfer and David Essex were up there with David Bowie and T. Rex. </p>
        		<p>When I started buying my own singles and albums they just added to the collection. When I ran out of stuff to listen to I would invariably end up listening to the man from Labyrinth with the funny stripe on his face and the other man with the nice eyes.</p>
        		<p>I question in this modern age what nine year olds can do to learn the music of their parents. Does a 2002 baby go through their Dad's iTunes in such a way? Spotify may have a vast majority of the worlds music at its disposal, but without such curation why would any child deviate from the latest sensation?</p>

		    	<p>The Transformer LP (I still have that original 70s one in my collection) has come with me through my teens and moving to London and growing up and getting married.</p>
		    	<p>Every time I listen to it Lou Reed seems to have predicted something about my life's up and downswings </p>
		    	<p>This isn't meant to be a review, tribute (and quite how any tribute can top Laurie Anderson's devastatingly beautiful summing up of their lives together I don't know) or history of the album. I know precious little about what he was up to at the time (aside from being brought out of a post Velvet Underground retirement) and a quick wikipedia tells me that he was three years younger then than I am now. And I have nothing like Transformer to my name (to my knowledge - answers on a postcard).</p>
<p>
If anything this is a track-by-track thank you, a mini autobiography of what these songs mean to me, a small fan living in a council flat in Cheltenham circa 1989. </p>

you want me to hit you with a stick<br />
But all I've got is a guitar pick<br />

When I see you walking down the street<br />
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet<br />

Of all the songs this one in hindsight appeals most to a ten year old, with lyrics such as "You know what they say about honey bears / When you shave of all their baby hairs / You have a hairy minded pink fair bear"
Her belly button was her mouth which meant she tasted what she'd speak.</p>
<p>but the way he sings the "ooo" in between the "funny thing is what happened to her nose" and "it grew until it reached all of toes" made Lou Reed sound, to me at least, like the father figure I lacked reading me a bedtime story. 
</p>
<p>And you wonder why I turned out weird (or great - delete as appropriate)

	<p>A brilliant tune, slightly ruined by that BBC advert (hard to listen without a vague ghost of "Reap, reap, reap / what you SOOOOOWWWW!!!!" Redeemed somewhat by its use in trainspotting (even if that did come first. But although its remembered as a Children In Need advert, wasn't it originally a unthinkable-in-present-tory-bbc-bashing-climate showing off of the 'unique way the BBC is funded "look at what we can afford to do with your money" thing?</p>
<p>The song itself, whether about drug use or not (yes) is blissful. Close your eyes on a crowded tube in November and the first few lines will make you feel like you are indeed drinking Sangria on a hot sunny afternoon.</p>
<p>It's also one of those oddities that since constantly re-listening in the last few weeks it occurs to me that Lou Reed's voice wasn't actually great, in the chorus it can waver a bit, but that it doesn't matter, not a jot. Why is this important? Well in this modern xfactor hashtag age I (and I think a lot of others) will randomly turn the tv on and exclaim how people can't sing and how that means we're all fucked. But its never really mattered, has it. What matters is that what is being sung about is being meant. Simple really.</p>

A song that seems far more apt in my 30s than any other "You're still doing things that I gave up years ago"</p>
These songs are very story based - I wonder now if listening to these on repeat was part of the childhood ouvre (urgh) that included Lou Reed, Roald Dahl, Stephen King etc was part of the formation.

	<p>A song so famous its hard to believe it ever once didn't exist. </p>
<p>Also one that helped with the 17 year old me, grappling with growing up and sexuality and wanting to get out of a smallish town and move to a city and all that.</p>
<p>Coloured girls, even at ten that sounded wrong. </p>

	<p>One of my favourites, the way at the start he says "blows me out of my mind" is one of those lines in music that you just fucking believe what you're being told. I [believe] that they did. although, the other day in my Post-lou-reed-death malaise I listened to the "definite" (according to Spotify bio writers) Lou Reed live album, hated this song on it because HE SANG IT WRONG - the tricky thing with a song and album tattooed in me over twenty years of repeated listening. </p>

	<p>This was the song that I first made the (obvious - especially as its written on the cover) connection about five years later that David Bowie is doing the backing vocals. Mind blown, as this ten year old didn't know it was allowed for people to appear on each others albums without being written in big letters on the front. </p>
