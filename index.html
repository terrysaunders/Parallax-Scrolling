			<p>Slowly lining up to hit my mid thirties means that idols of my youth are dying (or being arrested) at a rate of knots. </p>
			<p>I was slightly taken aback, however, at how much I was affected by the passing of Lou Reed. </p>
			<p>Although definitely a fan I wasn't super clued in to his life's work. I liked The Velvet Underground, I've tried to listen to Berlin several times and I had no idea what he'd done for the last ten years or so. </p>
			<p>But Transformer, now that album was special.  Transformer is in my top five albums. Odd as the rest of this list (and probably most of the top ten) are albums released in the years when I was between 16-19. </p>

		    	<p>I, like most people growing up in the early eighties had access to a vast analogue trove of music in the form of my mum's 70s LPs that were all lined up under the telly. </p>
		    	<p>This may have been pre-compact disc, cassette may have been king but having this slice of history under my eyeline when I was watching Tripod's or Blue Peter gave me endless fascination.</p>
				<p>Among this list were some gems but at this age of musical education all I had to go on were names and pictures and so  Manhattan Transfer and David Essex were up there with David Bowie and T. Rex. </p>
        		<p>When I started buying my own singles and albums they just added to the collection. When I ran out of stuff to listen to I would invariably end up listening to the man from Labyrinth with the funny stripe on his face and the other man with the nice eyes.</p>
        		<p>I question in this modern age what nine year olds can do to learn the music of their parents. Does a 2002 baby go through their Dad's iTunes in such a way? Spotify may have a vast majority of the worlds music at its disposal, but without such curation why would any child deviate from the latest sensation?</p>

		    	<p>The Transformer LP (I still have that original 70s one in my collection) has come with me through my teens and moving to London and growing up and getting married.</p>
		    	<p>Every time I listen to it Lou Reed seems to have predicted something about my life's up and downswings </p>
		    	<p>This isn't meant to be a review, tribute (and quite how any tribute can top Laurie Anderson's devastatingly beautiful summing up of their lives together I don't know) or history of the album. I know precious little about what he was up to at the time (aside from being brought out of a post Velvet Underground retirement) and a quick wikipedia tells me that he was three years younger then than I am now. And I have nothing like Transformer to my name (to my knowledge - answers on a postcard).</p>
<p>
If anything this is a track-by-track thank you, a mini autobiography of what these songs mean to me, a small fan living in a council flat in Cheltenham circa 1989. </p>

	<p>Vicious<br />
you hit me with a flower<br />
You do it every hour<br />
oh, baby, you're so vicious
</p>
<p>Vicious<br />
you want me to hit you with a stick<br />
But all I've got is a guitar pick<br />
huh, baby, you're so vicious<br />
</p>
<p>When I watch you come<br />
baby, I just want to run far away<br />
You're not the kind of person around I<br />
want to stay<br />
</p>
<p>
When I see you walking down the street<br />
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet<br />
You're not the kind of person that I want to meet<br />
</p>
<p>
Oh, baby, you're so vicious<br />
you're just so vicious<br />
</p>
<p>
Vicious<br />
hey, you hit me with a flower<br />
You do it every hour<br />
oh, baby you're so vicious<br />
</p>
<p>
Vicious<br />
hey, why don't you swallow razor blades<br />
You must think that I'm some kind of gay blade<br />
but baby, you're so vicious<br />
</p>
<p>
When I see you coming<br />
I just have to run<br />
You're not good and you certainly aren't<br />
very much fun<br />
</p>
<p>
When I see you walking down the street<br />
I step on your hand and I mangle your feet<br />
You're not the kind of person that I'd even want to meet<br />
</p>
<p>
'Cause you're so vicious<br />
baby, you're so vicious<br />
Vicious, vicious
vicious, vicious
Vicious, vicious
vicious, vicious</p></article>
